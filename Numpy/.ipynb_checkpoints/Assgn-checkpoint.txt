Consider the below code to answer further questions:
import numpy as np
list_ = [ ‘1’ , ’2’ , ‘3’ , ‘4’ , ‘5’ ]
array_list = np.array(object = list_)
Q1. Is there any difference in the data type of variables list_ and array_list? If there is then write a code
to print the data types of both the variables.
list, numpy.ndarray

Q2. Write a code to print the data type of each and every element of both the variables list_ and
arra_list.
for i in list_:
    print(type(i))
for i in array_list:
    print(type(i))

Q3. Considering the following changes in the variable, array_list:
array_list = np.array(object = list_, dtype = int)
Will there be any difference in the data type of the elements present in both the variables, list_ and
arra_list? If so then print the data types of each and every element present in both the variables, list_
and array_list. - yes, array_list will have int64 data type


Consider the below code to answer further questions:
import numpy as np
num_list = [ [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] , [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] ]
num_array = np.array(object = num_list)
Q4. Write a code to find the following characteristics of variable, num_array:
(i) shape - (2,3)
(ii) size - 6
Q5. Write a code to create numpy array of 3*3 matrix containing zeros only, using a numpy array
creation function. np.zeros((3,3))
[Hint: The size of the array will be 9 and the shape will be (3,3).]
Q6. Create an identity matrix of shape (5,5) using numpy functions? - np.eye(5)
[Hint: An identity matrix is a matrix containing 1 diagonally and other elements will be 0.]
