1.Write a Python program to create two processes that print out the numbers from 1 to 10 simultaneously.
2.Write a Python program that creates four processes and computes the sum of the first 1000 integers using multiprocessing
3.Write a Python program that creates two processes and communicates between them using a Queue. The first process should send a list of numbers to the second process, which should calculate the sum of the numbers and send it back to the first process.
4.Write a program to find the maximum number in a list of lists using multiprocessing.
5.Write a Python program that uses the Pool class from the multiprocessing module to calculate the squares of a list of integers.
6.How do you create a new process using the multiprocessing module in Python?
7.How do you use a Pool to execute a function with multiple arguments in parallel?
8.Write a Python program to calculate the sum of squares of numbers in a list using multiprocessing.
9.Write a Python program that uses the multiprocessing module to calculate the sum of a large list of integers.
10.Write a Python program that uses the multiprocessing module to parallelize the computation of the factorial of a number.
