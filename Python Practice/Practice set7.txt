and the other thread should print odd numbers between 1 and 9.
Q2. Write a program that generates a list of random numbers and sorts them using multithreading. Use
two threads to sort the first half and the second half of the list in parallel.
Q3. Write a program that simulates a bank account transaction. The program should create two threads,
one for a deposit and one for a withdrawal. The deposit thread should add

Q9. Write a program that creates two threads to add and subtract numbers from a shared variable. The
shared variable should start at 0, and each thread should perform 10 iterations of adding or subtracting a
random integer between 1 and 10. The program should print the final value of the shared variable.
