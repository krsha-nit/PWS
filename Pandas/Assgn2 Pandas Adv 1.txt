Q1. List any five functions of the pandas library with execution.
head(),tail(),sample(), type(df), df.dtypes
df.describe(), 

Q2. Given a Pandas DataFrame df with columns 'A', 'B', and 'C', write a Python function to re-index the
DataFrame with a new index that starts from 1 and increments by 2 for each row.

Q3. You have a Pandas DataFrame df with a column named 'Values'. Write a Python function that
iterates over the DataFrame and calculates the sum of the first three values in the 'Values' column. The
function should print the sum to the console.
For example, if the 'Values' column of df contains the values [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], your function should
calculate and print the sum of the first three values, which is 60.

Q4. Given a Pandas DataFrame df with a column 'Text', write a Python function to create a new column
'Word_Count' that contains the number of words in each row of the 'Text' column.
# df['Name len'] = df['Name'].apply(lambda x: len(x))

Q5. How are DataFrame.size() and DataFrame.shape() different?
df.shape = (row,col) and df.size = row*col

Q6. Which function of pandas do we use to read an excel file? pd.read_excel('file.xlxs',sheetname = 'sheetname')
Q7. You have a Pandas DataFrame df that contains a column named 'Email' that contains email
addresses in the format 'username@domain.com'. Write a Python function that creates a new column
'Username' in df that contains only the username part of each email address.
The username is the part of the email address that appears before the '@' symbol. For example, if the
email address is 'john.doe@example.com', the 'Username' column should contain 'john.doe'. Your
function should extract the username from each email address and store it in the new 'Username'
column.
# df_email['username']=df_email['email'].apply(lambda x: x.split('@')[0])
# df_email['domain']=df_email['email'].apply(lambda x: x.split('@')[1]).apply(lambda x: x.split('.')[0])

Q8. You have a Pandas DataFrame df with columns 'A', 'B', and 'C'. Write a Python function that selects
all rows where the value in column 'A' is greater than 5 and the value in column 'B' is less than 10. The
function should return a new DataFrame that contains only the selected rows.
For example, if df contains the following values:
A B C
0 3 5 1
1 8 2 7
2 6 9 4
3 2 3 5
4 9 1 2
Your function should select the following rows: A B C
1 8 2 7
4 9 1 2
The function should return a new DataFrame that contains only the selected rows.

# fil_df = df[(df['A'] > 5) & (df['B'] < 10)]

Q9. Given a Pandas DataFrame df with a column 'Values', write a Python function to calculate the mean,
median, and standard deviation of the values in the 'Values' column.
# df['Fare'].mean(), df['Fare'].median(), df['Fare'].std()

Q10. Given a Pandas DataFrame df with a column 'Sales' and a column 'Date', write a Python function to
create a new column 'MovingAverage' that contains the moving average of the sales for the past 7 days
for each row in the DataFrame. The moving average should be calculated using a window of size 7 and
should include the current day.


Q11. You have a Pandas DataFrame df with a column 'Date'. Write a Python function that creates a new
column 'Weekday' in the DataFrame. The 'Weekday' column should contain the weekday name (e.g.
Monday, Tuesday) corresponding to each date in the 'Date' column.
For example, if df contains the following values:
Date
0 2023-01-01
1 2023-01-02
2 2023-01-03
3 2023-01-04
4 2023-01-05
Your function should create the following DataFrame:

Date Weekday
0 2023-01-01 Sunday
1 2023-01-02 Monday
2 2023-01-03 Tuesday
3 2023-01-04 Wednesday
4 2023-01-05 Thursday
The function should return the modified DataFrame.

# dt_df['WeekDay'] = dt_df['Date'].apply(lambda x: x.strftime('%A'))

Q12. Given a Pandas DataFrame df with a column 'Date' that contains timestamps, write a Python
function to select all rows where the date is between '2023-01-01' and '2023-01-31'.

# df2[(df2['Date']>='2023-01-01') & (df2['Date']<='2023-01-31')]

Q13. To use the basic functions of pandas, what is the first and foremost necessary library that needs to
be imported?

# import pandas as pd?
