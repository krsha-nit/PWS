Consider following code to answer further questions:
import pandas as pd
course_name = [‘Data Science’, ‘Machine Learning’, ‘Big Data’, ‘Data Engineer’]
duration = [2,3,6,4]
df = pd.DataFrame(data = {‘course_name’ : course_name, ‘duration’ : duration})
Q1. Write a code to print the data present in the second row of the dataframe, df.
df7[1:2]
df7.iloc[1:2]
df7.iloc[[1]]

Q2. What is the difference between the functions loc and iloc in pandas.DataFrame?
loc - if named index, have to pass index name, iloc - even for named index, work like default index starts 0 to n

Q3. Reindex the given dataframe using a variable, reindex = [3,0,1,2] and store it in the variable, new_df 
then find the output for both new_df.loc[2] and new_df.iloc[2].
new_df.loc[2] = same
new_df.iloc[2] = new_df.loc[1]

Did you observe any difference in both the outputs? If so then explain it.
yes, 
new_df.loc[2] = same
new_df.iloc[2] = new_df.loc[1]

Consider the below code to answer further questions:
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
columns = ['column_1', 'column_2', 'column_3', 'column_4', 'column_5', 'column_6']
indices = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
#Creating a dataframe:
df1 = pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(6,6), columns = columns, index = indices)

Q4. Write a code to find the following statistical measurements for the above dataframe df1:
(i) mean of each and every column present in the dataframe.
df1.mean() # df.describe()

(ii) standard deviation of column, ‘column_2’
df1.std(), df1['column_2'].std()

Q5. Replace the data present in the second row of column, ‘column_2’ by a string variable then find the
mean of column, column_2.
[Hint: To replace the data use df1.loc[] and equate this to string data of your choice.]
If you are getting errors in executing it then explain why.

df1.loc[2,'column_2'] = 'str'
column - will provide mean of all columns but, column_2
column_2 will give error as can't compute mean with num and str values


Q6. What do you understand about the windows function in pandas and list the types of windows
functions?


Q7. Write a code to print only the current month and year at the time of answering this question.
[Hint: Use pandas.datetime function]

from datetime import date
today = date.today()
current_date = today.day
current_month = today.month
current_year = today.year
current_date, current_month, current_year

Q8. Write a Python program that takes in two dates as input (in the format YYYY-MM-DD) and
calculates the difference between them in days, hours, and minutes using Pandas time delta. The
program should prompt the user to enter the dates and display the result.
--Attempt again..
import pandas as pd
#dt2 = pd.date_range(start='2023-03-02',end='2023-03-03')
start = pd.to_datetime(input('Enter Start Date: '))
end = pd.to_datetime(input('Enter end Date: '))
diff = pd.Timedelta(end - start,'h')
print('Date diff is {}'.format(diff))


Q9. Write a Python program that reads a CSV file containing categorical data and converts a specified
column to a categorical data type. The program should prompt the user to enter the file path, column
name, and category order, and then display the sorted data.
??

Q10. Write a Python program that reads a CSV file containing sales data for different products and
visualizes the data using a stacked bar chart to show the sales of each product category over time. The
program should prompt the user to enter the file path and display the chart.


Q11. You are given a CSV file containing student data that includes the student ID and their test score. Write
a Python program that reads the CSV file, calculates the mean, median, and mode of the test scores, and
displays the results in a table.
The program should do the followingM
I Prompt the user to enter the file path of the CSV file containing the student dataR
I Read the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrameR
I Calculate the mean, median, and mode of the test scores using Pandas toolsR
I Display the mean, median, and mode in a table.
Assume the CSV file contains the following columnsM
I Student ID: The ID of the studentR
I Test Score: The score of the student's test.
Example usage of the program:
Enter the file path of the CSV file containing the student data: student_data.csv
+-----------+--------+
| Statistic | Value |
+-----------+--------+
| Mean | 79.6 |
| Median | 82 |
| Mode | 85, 90 |
+-----------+--------+
Assume that the CSV file student_data.csv contains the following data:
Student ID,Test Score
1,85
2,90
3,80
4,75
5,85
6,82
7,78
8,85
9,90
10,85
The program should calculate the mean, median, and mode of the test scores and display the results
in a table.
