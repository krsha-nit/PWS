    "#### Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "    Ans. In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It encapsulates data and functions into a single unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "    An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity or instance that has its own unique data and can perform actions defined by the class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Ex - Consider a class named Car that defines the properties and behavior of a car. An object of the Car class could be my_car, representing a specific car instance with its own unique attributes (e.g., make, model, color) and the ability to perform actions (e.g., start, accelerate, stop) defined by the Car class."

    "#### Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "    Ans. - Four Pillars of OOPs are: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data and related behaviors (methods) into a single unit called a class. It allows for data hiding and provides control over accessing and modifying the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inheritance: Inheritance allows a class (child class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent class). It promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables methods to be overridden in subclasses, providing different implementations while maintaining a consistent interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on providing a simplified and generalized representation of real-world objects. It involves defining classes and methods that hide complex implementation details and expose only essential features, allowing for easier understanding and usage."

    "#### Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "    Ans. The __init__() function is used in Python classes as a constructor method. It is automatically called when an object is created from a class and is used to initialize the object's attributes or perform any necessary setup. This allows us to set the initial state of an object by defining its attributes and their initial values. It provides a convenient way to ensure that every newly created object of a class starts with the desired state and has its necessary attributes initialized."

    "    Ans. Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. The class that inherits is called the \"subclass\" or \"derived class,\" and the class from which it inherits is called the \"superclass\" or \"base class.\" "
