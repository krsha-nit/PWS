    "# Objective: The objective of this assignment is to gain practical experience with fundamental operations in TensorFlow, including creating and manipulating matrices, performing arithmetic operations on tensors, and understanding the difference between TensorFlow constants and variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Theoretical Question\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. What are the different data structures used in Tensorflow? Give some examples.\n",
    "Ans. TensorFlow primarily uses two main data structures: tensors and graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors: Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays used to represent data in TensorFlow. They can have various ranks (dimensions) like scalars, vectors, matrices, or higher-dimensional arrays. Tensors can hold numerical values, such as integers or floating-point numbers. Examples of tensors include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Scalar (Rank-0 tensor): A single number, e.g., 5.\n",
    "    Vector (Rank-1 tensor): A 1-dimensional array, e.g., [1, 2, 3].\n",
    "    Matrix (Rank-2 tensor): A 2-dimensional array, e.g., [[1, 2], [3, 4]].\n",
    "    Higher-dimensional tensor (e.g., Rank-3, Rank-4, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs: TensorFlow uses a computational graph to represent and perform operations on tensors. A graph consists of nodes (representing operations) and edges (representing data flow, i.e., tensors). TensorFlow constructs a graph to describe the computations, and then executes it within a session.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.  How does the TensorFlow constant differ from a TensorFlow variable? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Ans. TensorFlow Constant: A constant in TensorFlow is a type of tensor whose value cannot be changed after its initialization. It is typically used to represent fixed values in the graph. Once a constant is defined, its value remains the same throughout the execution of the program.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "    # Creating a TensorFlow constant\n",
    "    constant_tensor = tf.constant([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "    \n",
    "TensorFlow Variable: A variable in TensorFlow is a type of tensor that can be modified during the execution of the program. Variables are used to store and update values that might change during training, such as model weights.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import tensorflow as tf                \n",
    "    # Creating a TensorFlow variable\n",
    "    initial_value = [0, 0]\n",
    "    variable_tensor = tf.Variable(initial_value)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.  Describe the process of matrix addition, multiplication, and element-wise operations in TensorFlow.\n",
    "Ans. Matrix Addition: In TensorFlow, matrix addition is performed using the tf.add() function or the + operator. The matrices should have the same dimensions for addition to be valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "    import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "    # Define two matrices\n",
    "    matrix_A = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
    "    matrix_B = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n",
    "    # Perform matrix addition\n",
    "    matrix_sum = tf.add(matrix_A, matrix_B)\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix Multiplication: In TensorFlow, matrix multiplication is performed using the tf.matmul() function or the @ operator. The inner dimensions of the matrices must match for multiplication to be valid (e.g., if A is of shape (m, n) and B is of shape (n, p), then C = A @ B will result in a matrix of shape (m, p)).\n",
    "\n",
    "    import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "    # Define two matrices\n",
    "    matrix_C = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
    "    matrix_D = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n",
    "    # Perform matrix multiplication\n",
    "    matrix_product = tf.matmul(matrix_C, matrix_D)\n",
    "\n",
    "Element-wise Operations: Element-wise operations in TensorFlow are operations that are performed on corresponding elements of two tensors of the same shape. Element-wise operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more. For element-wise operations, the tensors must have the same shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "    import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "    # Define two matrices\n",
    "    matrix_E = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
    "    matrix_F = tf.constant([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n",
    "    # Perform element-wise addition\n",
    "    elementwise_sum = tf.add(matrix_E, matrix_F)\n",
    "    # Perform element-wise multiplication\n",
    "    elementwise_product = tf.multiply(matrix_E, matrix_F)"
