    "#### Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with an example.\n",
    "    Ans. Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "    Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are concepts used in probability theory and statistics to describe the probability distribution of discrete and continuous random variables, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "    The PMF is a function that gives the probability of a discrete random variable taking on a specific value. For each possible value of the random variable, the PMF assigns a probability between 0 and 1, and the sum of all these probabilities is equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "    Let's consider a fair six-sided die. The PMF of this random variable would be:\n",
    "    PMF(X = x) = 1/6 for x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n",
    "    PMF(X = x) = 0 for all other values of x\n",
    "\n",
    "    Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "    The PDF is a function that gives the probability density of a continuous random variable at a specific value. Unlike the PMF, which provides the probability of getting a specific value, the PDF provides the probability density around that value. The probability of the random variable falling within a given interval is obtained by integrating the PDF over that interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "    Consider a standard normal distribution (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1). The PDF of this random variable is given by the bell-shaped curve known as the Gaussian curve or bell curve."

    "#### Q9: What is Central Limit Theorem? State the significance of the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "    Ans. The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics. It states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean (or the sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables) approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In simpler terms, if we take multiple random samples of the same size from any population, calculate the mean of each sample, and plot a histogram of these sample means, the resulting distribution will closely resemble a normal distribution, even if the population distribution is not normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Significance of the Central Limit Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Justification for Inference: It allows us to use parametric statistical methods, like hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, even when the underlying population distribution is not known. We can assume normality of the sample mean, which simplifies statistical calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    General Applicability: The CLT is applicable to a wide range of situations and population distributions. As long as certain assumptions are met (sample size is sufficiently large, observations are independent and identically distributed), the sample mean will be approximately normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Efficient Estimation: With a normal distribution assumption, statistical estimators (like sample mean and sample variance) become efficient and unbiased. This property is crucial for making accurate inferences about population parameters.\n",

    "#### Q10: State the assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "    Ans. For the Central Limit Theorem to hold, there are certain assumptions that must be satisfied:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Random Sampling: The samples should be drawn randomly from the population of interest. This means that every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Independent Observations: The observations within each sample must be independent of each other. In other words, the value of one observation should not influence or be influenced by the value of another observation in the same sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Identically Distributed: All samples should be drawn from the same population, and the distribution of the population should have a well-defined mean (μ) and finite variance (σ^2).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sufficiently Large Sample Size: The sample size should be \"sufficiently large.\" Although there is no strict rule for what constitutes a large sample size, as a general guideline, a sample size of around 30 or larger is often considered sufficient for the CLT to provide a good approximation to the normal distribution."
