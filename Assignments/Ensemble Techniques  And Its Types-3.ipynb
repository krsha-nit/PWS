    "### Q1. What is Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "Ans. Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method used for regression tasks. It is based on the Random Forest algorithm, which combines multiple decision trees to make more accurate and stable predictions. Each decision tree in the ensemble is trained on a different bootstrap sample of the training data and a random subset of features. The final prediction of the Random Forest Regressor is obtained by aggregating the predictions of individual trees, typically using averaging for regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. How does Random Forest Regressor reduce the risk of overfitting?\n",
    "Ans. Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through two main mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Bootstrapping: Each decision tree in the Random Forest is trained on a random bootstrap sample of the training data. This bootstrapping process introduces diversity among the trees, as they see slightly different subsets of the data. As a result, the individual trees may overfit to different parts of the data, but their ensemble average helps reduce the overall variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Feature Randomness: When training each tree, only a random subset of features is considered at each split. By using only a subset of features, the Random Forest Regressor avoids relying too heavily on any single feature and ensures that no individual tree dominates the decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of bootstrapping and feature randomness helps to create an ensemble of diverse and less correlated decision trees, leading to a more robust and generalized model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. How does Random Forest Regressor aggregate the predictions of multiple decision trees?\n",
    "Ans. In Random Forest Regressor, each decision tree in the ensemble independently predicts the target variable for a given input sample. The final prediction of the Random Forest Regressor is obtained by aggregating the predictions of all individual trees. For regression tasks, the typical aggregation method is to take the average of the predictions made by each tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, if there are n decision trees in the Random Forest, and each tree makes a prediction y_i for a given input sample, the final prediction y_pred of the Random Forest Regressor for that sample is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    y_pred = (y_1 + y_2 + ... + y_n) / n\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. What are the hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "Ans. The key hyperparameters of the Random Forest Regressor include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    n_estimators: The number of decision trees in the ensemble (typically set to a higher value for better performance).\n",
    "    max_depth: The maximum depth of each decision tree in the ensemble (to control the depth and complexity of individual trees).\n",
    "    min_samples_split: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.\n",
    "    min_samples_leaf: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.\n",
    "    max_features: The number of features to consider when looking for the best split at each node. It can be an absolute number or a fraction of the total features.\n",
    "    random_state: The random seed for reproducibility.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Q5. What is the difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor?\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Ensemble vs. Single Tree: Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees, whereas Decision Tree Regressor is a single decision tree algorithm.\n",
    "    Overfitting: Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through bootstrapping and feature randomness, whereas Decision Tree Regressor is more prone to overfitting as it tries to fit the data precisely.\n",
    "    Prediction Aggregation: Random Forest Regressor aggregates the predictions of multiple trees (typically using averaging), whereas Decision Tree Regressor directly outputs the prediction of a single tree.\n",
    "    Model Complexity: Random Forest Regressor can handle complex relationships in the data due to its ensemble nature, while Decision Tree Regressor is limited by the single tree's structure.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Q6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Effective in handling complex relationships in data.\n",
    "    Reduces overfitting through ensemble averaging and feature randomness.\n",
    "    Robust to noisy data and outliers.\n",
    "    Provides feature importance scores for feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Can be computationally expensive for large datasets and high n_estimators.\n",
    "    Difficult to interpret compared to a single decision tree.\n",
    "    May not perform well on small datasets with limited diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. What is the output of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "Ans. The output of the Random Forest Regressor is a continuous numerical value. For each input sample, the model predicts a real-valued number representing the target variable's regression value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8. Can Random Forest Regressor be used for classification tasks?\n",
    "Ans. No, Random Forest Regressor is specifically designed for regression tasks, where the target variable is continuous. For classification tasks, the appropriate algorithm is Random Forest Classifier, which is designed to handle categorical or discrete target variables."
