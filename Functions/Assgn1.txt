Q1. Which keyword is used to create a function?  - def function_name(arg,*args,**kwargs):
Create a function to return a list of odd numbers in the
range of 1 to 25.
def odd_numbers(list_):
    a = []
    for i in list_:
        if i%2 != 0:
            a.append(i)
    
    return a

Q2. Why *args and **kwargs is used in some functions? Create a function each for *args and **kwargs to
demonstrate their use.
*args - dynamically pass unknown number of arguments
**kwargs - dynamically pass unknown key, value pairs

Q3. What is an iterator in python? 
-https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterators-in-python/

Name the method used to initialise the iterator object and the method
used for iteration. 
-yield?

Use these methods to print the first five elements of the given list [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16,
18, 20].


Q4. What is a generator function in python? Why yield keyword is used? Give an example of a generator
function.
range(n)
Q5. Create a generator function for prime numbers less than 1000. Use the next() method to print the first 20 prime numbers.
def prime_num2(n):
    cnt = 0
    #prime = []
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        for j in range(1,i+1):
            if i%j ==0:
                cnt+=1
        if cnt==2:
            #prime.append(i)
            yield i
        cnt=0
    
    #return prime
