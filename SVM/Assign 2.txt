Q1. What is the relationship between polynomial functions and kernel functions in machine learning
algorithms?
Q2. How can we implement an SVM with a polynomial kernel in Python using Scikit-learn?
Q3. How does increasing the value of epsilon affect the number of support vectors in SVR?
Q4. How does the choice of kernel function, C parameter, epsilon parameter, and gamma parameter
affect the performance of Support Vector Regression (SVR)? Can you explain how each parameter works
and provide examples of when you might want to increase or decrease its value?
Q5. Assignment:
L Import the necessary libraries and load the dataseg
L Split the dataset into training and testing setZ
L Preprocess the data using any technique of your choice (e.g. scaling, normaliMationK
L Create an instance of the SVC classifier and train it on the training datW
L hse the trained classifier to predict the labels of the testing datW
L Evaluate the performance of the classifier using any metric of your choice (e.g. accuracy,
precision, recall, F1-scoreK
L Tune the hyperparameters of the SVC classifier using GridSearchCV or RandomiMedSearchCV to
improve its performanc_
L Train the tuned classifier on the entire dataseg
L Save the trained classifier to a file for future use.

You can use any dataset of your choice for this assignment, but make sure it is suitable for
classification and has a sufficient number of features and samples.
