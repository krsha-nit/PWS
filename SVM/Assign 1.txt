Q1. What is the mathematical formula for a linear SVM?
Q2. What is the objective function of a linear SVM?
Q3. What is the kernel trick in SVM?
Q4. What is the role of support vectors in SVM Explain with example
Q5. Illustrate with examples and graphs of Hyperplane, Marginal plane, Soft margin and Hard margin in
SVM?
Q6. SVM Implementation through Iris dataset.
~ Load the iris dataset from the scikit-learn library and split it into a training set and a testing setl
~ Train a linear SVM classifier on the training set and predict the labels for the testing setl
~ Compute the accuracy of the model on the testing setl
~ Plot the decision boundaries of the trained model using two of the featuresl
~ Try different values of the regularisation parameter C and see how it affects the performance of
the model.

Bonus task: Implement a linear SVM classifier from scratch using Python and compare its
performance with the scikit-learn implementation.
